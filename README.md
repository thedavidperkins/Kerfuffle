A Dungeons and Dragons DM encounter planning tool

This tool is intended to simulate D&D encounters to determine relative difficulty. Ideally the tool will give the Dungeon Master a reasonable expectation as to how challenging an encounter will be.

Encounters will be defined as a list of players and a list of foes. Each will have a well-defined set of possible actions, according to 5e rules. As the tool is developed, simulated encounters will improve in emulating real player decisions, and randomness will be left increasingly to the dice. The tool will run the encounter thousands of times and give aggregate statistics on expected outcomes.

I am developing this mostly for fun, and I have no formal experience with designing game AIs. This will be a learning experience for me.
